Drivy Backend Challenge

This is the Drivy backend challenge I worked on. It contains 5 levels, each one has an input.json file and we want to output the result as another json file. I solved this exercise using OOP, by creating classes and objects. 

When running ```$ ruby main.rb``` in the level folder, it will generate an output.json file matching the desired format (from the expected_output.json file). I hope you'll enjoy my code!
